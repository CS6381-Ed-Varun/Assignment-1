# CS6381 Programming Assignment #1

## Overview
In this assignment we will build upon the PUB/SUB model supported by the ZeroMQ (ZMQ) middleware. 
One of the downsides of ZMQâ€™s approach is that there is no anonymity between publishers and subscribers. 
A subscriber needs to know where the publisher is (i.e., subscriber must explicitly connect to a publisher using its IP address and port). 
So, we lose some degree of decoupling with such an approach (recall the time, space, and synchronization decoupling that we studied). 
A more desirable solution is where application logic of the publishers and subscribers remains anonymous to each other; 
naturally something else will still need to maintain the association. 
This entity is the pub-sub middleware, which is the focus of this assignment.

## Installation
Activate the Python Environment Variables:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

To deactivate the Python Environment Variables:
```bash
deactivate
```

Manual installation: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/edmasters/single_broker_pub_sub.git
cd single_broker_pub-sub
```

If you have `pip` installed, then
```bash
pip install -e .
```

If you do not have `pip`, then
```bash
python setup.py install
```
Activate the Python Environment Variables:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```
## Mininet Emulation
Assign the various hosts as either publisher or subscriber. 
Subsequently, passing the parameters for the stock ticker and API method will generate the connections.
The latencies will be exported to a csv and an analysis can be replicated with offline_analysis.py
```bash
sudo mn --topo single,6

mininet> h2 python3 floodproxy.py &
mininet> h3 python3 subscriber.py 12345 BROKER &
mininet> h4 python3 publisher.py 12345 BROKER &
mininet> h5 python3 subscriber.py 54321 FLOOD &
mininet> h6 python3 publisher.py 54321 FLOOD &
```
